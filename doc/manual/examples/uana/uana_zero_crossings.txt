This UAna counts the number of zero crossings in the sample buffer and outputs
the count in the first element of the UAnaBlob's magnitude buffer (fvals). Only
UAna inputs are considered. See the Flip UAna for converting a UGen's signal
into the analysis domain. If the input buffer is non-empty, this assumes a
"half" crossing, so 0.5 is added to the output. This is why the "counted" result
is a float and not an int.
